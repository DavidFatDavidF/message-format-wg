# Decision making process

## Preamble
The Chair Group discussion led to a consensus to start with a light weight consensus-based process that would eventually use voting as a last resort method in case of impasse.. The group could eventually be in need to defend its decision making process against trolls, yet at the moment all group members are considered in good faith, so the working group reserves the option to specify disciplinary actions against trolls as part of its guidelines at a later stage..

## Definitions
1. *Consensus* is defined as lack of sustained opposition.
2. *Good standing* is a characteristic of group members who fullfill their implicit and explicit obligations and hence are allowed to excercise all of their rights within the group without restriction.
3. *Blacklist* (*blacklisted*, *blacklisting*) is a taxative enumeration of group members who are temporarily excluded from exercising their rights within the group.
4. *Normative keywords* as defined in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14)

## Rules
1. Any current group member is deemed to be in good standing unless blacklisted.
2. Any group member in good standing MAY make a proposal to the group via
    - raising an issue,
    - PR (against the repo or wiki), or
    - orally in a monthly group meeting.
3. Approval or rejection of proposed solutions and decisions SHOULD be driven by consensus.
4. Consensus MAY be reached as part of the PR or issue resolution process.
5. The monthly group meeting has the ultimate decision making authority.
    - Chair Group or Chair don't have a decision making authority, see [chair-group.md](chair-group.md) and [chair-group-members.md](chair-group-members.md).
6. In case consensus cannot be found over multiple iterations of arguments and counter arguments, a monthly group meeting MAY reach consensus to mandate the Chair Group to organize a ballot among all group members in good standing. The ballot wording, options, and success criteria SHOULD be explicitely defined in a monthly meeting. The Chair Group only administers and implements the ballot and its results.
7. Blacklisting procedure is TBD by monthly meeting consensus if and when needed.
